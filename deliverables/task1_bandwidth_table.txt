Notes:
- Carson's Rule: B = 2(Δf + fm), where fm = 53 kHz (max composite frequency)
- Measured bandwidth contains 99% of total signal power
- β = Δf/fm is the modulation index

ANALYSIS: BANDWIDTH vs SNR TRADE-OFF
================================================================================


1. Bandwidth Analysis:
   - Δf = 50 kHz: Theoretical = 206 kHz, Measured = 115 kHz
   - Δf = 75 kHz: Theoretical = 256 kHz, Measured = 158 kHz
   - Δf = 100 kHz: Theoretical = 306 kHz, Measured = 191 kHz

2. SNR Analysis:
   - Δf = 50 kHz: Output SNR = -1.7 dB
   - Δf = 75 kHz: Output SNR = -1.8 dB
   - Δf = 100 kHz: Output SNR = 0.5 dB

3. Trade-off Discussion:
   The fundamental trade-off in FM broadcasting is between:
   - BANDWIDTH: Higher Δf requires more spectrum
   - SNR IMPROVEMENT: FM provides SNR gain proportional to β²

   From our measurements:
   - Highest output SNR: 0.5 dB at Δf = 100 kHz
   - This uses bandwidth of 191 kHz

4. FM Improvement Factor:
   FM provides SNR improvement over baseband by factor of 3β²
   where β = Δf/fm (modulation index)

   - β = 0.94: Theoretical improvement = 4.3 dB
   - β = 1.42: Theoretical improvement = 7.8 dB
   - β = 1.89: Theoretical improvement = 10.3 dB

RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For FM stereo broadcasting, Δf = 75 kHz is the optimal choice because:

1. It is the standard frequency deviation for FM broadcasting (FCC specification)

2. It provides a good balance between:
   - Spectrum efficiency (256 kHz bandwidth per Carson's rule)
   - Audio quality (good SNR improvement)
   - Compatibility with standard FM receivers

3. The 200 kHz channel spacing used in FM broadcasting is designed for
   this deviation, allowing adjacent channel operation.

4. Higher deviations (100 kHz) provide slightly better SNR but:
   - Exceed standard specifications
   - May cause adjacent channel interference
   - Are not compatible with standard receivers

5. Lower deviations (50 kHz) waste the available channel bandwidth
   without providing any benefit.
